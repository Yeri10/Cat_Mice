# Project Description

Cat & Mouse: Multiplayer Territory Game is a real-time multiplayer interactive system that transforms shared digital space into a playable territory of pursuit, evasion, and spatial negotiation.

Players join the same room through a shared browser link and are assigned roles: one Cat and multiple Mice. Once the game begins, all participants appear within a shared 2D spatial environment where movement, distance, and proximity determine the outcome of the game.

The project explores multiplayer presence, spatial interaction, and performative digital territory through playful competition and collaboration.

# Gameplay

Players enter the same room through a shared browser link.
Click a seat to join the game.
The host starts the game.
The system automatically assigns roles (Cat / Mouse).

All players enter a shared map.
Use the keyboard (WASD or arrow keys) to move.
The Cat chases the Mice.
When a Mouse is touched by the Cat, it becomes caught and can no longer move.
The game includes a countdown timer.
The game ends when time runs out or when all Mice have been caught.

#  Concept

This project investigates how multiplayer interaction can transform digital interfaces into shared spatial territories.

Instead of focusing on narrative gameplay, the system foregrounds spatial relationships between participants. Pursuit and evasion become relational mechanics, while the shared environment functions as a performative field where presence is continuously negotiated.

The project sits between:

* Multiplayer game design
* Spatial interaction systems
* Post-digital embodiment
* Performative interface design

# Technology

* p5.js
* Node.js
* Socket.io (real-time multiplayer)
* HTML / CSS
* JavaScript
* Local server networking

#  Inspiration / Reference

Hanna, W. and Barbera, J. (1940) *Tom and Jerry*. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

This project draws inspiration from the spatial chase dynamics and relational tension between cat and mouse characters, translating animated pursuit structures into a multiplayer interactive spatial system.
